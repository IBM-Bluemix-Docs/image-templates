# Deleting an image template
{: #deleting-an-image-template}

Standard image templates can be deleted at any time after they are created.

Upon deletion, image templates cannot be retrieved and are
wiped permanently from all data centers. Use the following steps to delete an image template.

1. From the **Devices** menu in the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal_full}} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/), select **Manage > Images**.
2. Click **Actions** for the image template that you want to delete and select **Delete**.
3. Select **Yes** on the confirmation box to complete the deletion. Select **No** to cancel the deletion.

After an image template is deleted, the template is no longer available to use. All devices that were created by using the template remain
available and fully functional. However, no additional devices can be created by using the deleted template. Image templates cannot be recovered after they are deleted.
